"""
Run train.py and analyze.py on Modal: one GPU per run, every run of a sweep at once.

Scaffold: SWEEPS is empty until the experiments exist. Before the first cloud run, read
.agents/instructions/cloud.md and the Cloud Runs notes in CLAUDE.md, then set GPU, HOURS and
SWEEPS, plus a prepare() step if runs share downloaded or generated data.

The scripts run unchanged, in a container built from pyproject.toml and uv.lock. runs/ and
data/ live on Modal Volumes, so results outlast the container, and `just cloud-get <run>`
copies a run back into runs/. Figures and Hugging Face uploads stay local.

  just cloud <sweep>                  every run in SWEEPS[<sweep>], in parallel
  just cloud-train <run> '<flags>'    one run
